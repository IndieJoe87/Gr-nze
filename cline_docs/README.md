# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: READ THIS FIRST ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Documentation First Protocol

### üîç ALWAYS Check These Documents First
Before making ANY changes to the codebase, you MUST read these documents in order:

1. `projectRoadmap.md`
   - Review project goals and progress
   - Check completion criteria
   - Understand current priorities

2. `currentTask.md`
   - Understand active objectives
   - Review context and dependencies
   - Note next steps

3. `techStack.md`
   - Verify technology choices
   - Review architecture decisions
   - Check for constraints

4. `codebaseSummary.md`
   - Review recent changes
   - Understand component interactions
   - Check external dependencies

### ‚úèÔ∏è Update Protocol
After making changes:
1. Update relevant documentation IMMEDIATELY
2. Keep changes atomic and focused
3. Ensure documentation reflects current state
4. Cross-reference between documents when needed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
Failure to follow this protocol may result in:
- Inconsistent documentation
- Misaligned development efforts
- Technical debt
- Communication issues

### üîÑ Documentation Cycle
```
READ first ‚Üí UNDERSTAND context ‚Üí MAKE changes ‚Üí UPDATE docs ‚Üí COMMIT
```

Remember: Documentation is not a chore; it's a crucial part of our development process.
